## Overview
We use the R data (human_vs_bot.RData) found in the data directory and perfom logisitc regression. 


We do not create separate scripts for the predictive and ROC curve statistics; a decision table is constructed using helper functions that are 
included within the mail file: `read_simulatedData_logReg_andPlots.py`
