# Human-vs-Bot

This repository explores the classification of human vs. bot click behavior using simulated data and machine learning models.

## Overview

This project includes:
- Simulated click behavior data
- A logistic regression model
- Other machine learning models (in progress)

Each linked HTML page provides a full explanation of the rationale, methods, and results behind the associated R scripts. Below is a brief overview of the current R code.

## 🔍 Logistic Regression

### 📁 Files
  - simulatedData_andPrep.R
    Generates synthetic data and prepares it for classification. The simulated dataset is also shared with the SVM and Random Forest models for consistency across methods.

  - logistic_regression.R
    Builds logistic regression models, evaluates performance, and visualizes results using ggplot2.
