# Human-vs-Bot

Welcome! This repository explores the classification of human vs. bot response behavior using simulated data and machine learning models.
We begin with feature engineering, apply classification models, and evaluate performance using a variety of metrics and visualizations in both R and Python.


## Recent Updates

This repository is still under construction, but most R and Python code will continue to work if the appropriate data and models are used.

- **May 2025**: Renamed all columns containing `"click"` to `"response"` for clarity. Relevant code and datasets have been updated. Older files
  may still contain outdated column names and are being phased out.

**Note:** This project was originally developed using Git and Visual Studio on a laptop that experienced overheating issues when running R, Python, 
Jupyter Notebook, and Git simultaneously. Development resumed on a backup machine with base R (without RStudio). Current development is occurring 
in Visual Studio with R integration. A few technical issues remain but are being resolved. Thank you for your patience!



## Overview

This project includes:
- Simulated response behavior data
- A logistic regression model
- Other machine learning models 

Each linked HTML page provides a full explanation of the rationale, methods, and results behind the associated R scripts. Below is a brief overview 
of the current R code.

## üìä Simulating Data
This module focuses on simulating test data to perform analyis in R and Python; this project will be expanded to include SQL.

### üìÅ Files
  - helperFunctions_simulateCases ‚Äî Contains all helper functions used to generate synthetic response data for both human and bot users.
  - simulatedData_andPrep ‚Äî creates training and test data frames; encompasses data management

  
### üß† Overview
This project was sparked by an unexpected failure: I was unable to scrape a website using standard R tools. That led me to consider the 
problem from another angle: how do we distinguish bot behavior from human behavior? And if I cannot get it from the internet, can I just 
simulate it.

In our current digital environment, one possible differentiator is timing. Specifically, if bots and humans follow different time distributions for
response times; could that be used as a basis for classification?

The main goal of this module is to simulate realistic user session data, where each session consists of multiple responses, each with a timestamp. The output includes:
- a unique `id` per user
- a `sessioin_id` for mulitple-session users
- timestamps from the first to the last response in each session

Users can also specify whether duplicate IDs are allowed, enabling more complex simulation scenarios.
Data generation is handled by four core functions:

- human_startTimes
- human_timesDistributionDF

- bot_startTimes
- bot_timesDistributionDF

The *_startTimes() functions generate user/session combinations, while the *_timesDistributionDF() functions create response-timestamp data based on human-like or bot-like timing patterns.
The functios distinguish resposne times using the normal distribution for `humans` and an exponential for 'bots.'

That is, without knowing what characteristics differentiate human and bot behavior on a website, respsonse times were considered and used for model development:
if different models can classify cases based on a rate variable, the simulated data is representative of two different populations. Whether it does
portray real life data for humans and bots would need further analysis and real data.

## üîç Logistic Regression

### üìÅ Files
  - simulatedData_andPrep.R
    Generates synthetic data and prepares it for classification. The simulated dataset is also shared with the SVM and Random Forest models for consistency across methods.

  - logistic_regression.R
    Builds logistic regression models, evaluates performance, and visualizes results using ggplot2.
