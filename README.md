# Human-vs-Bot

<strong>The files listed under Human-vs-Bot</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Simulating Data</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression Model</li>
  <li>Other Machine Learning Model</li>
</ul>

each have a link that fully explain the rational and results for their creation. Here we attempt to review the R files associated with the Human-vs-Bot repository.

## Simulating Data
There are two files associated with this:
<ul> 
  <li>helperFunctions_simulatedCases.R</li>
  <li>simulatedData_andPrep.R</li>
</ul>

## Logistic Regression
There is one file associated with this:
<ul> 
  <li>logistic_regression.R</li>
</ul>
The R file does not only include the code for model development, but it also tests the model's performance.
